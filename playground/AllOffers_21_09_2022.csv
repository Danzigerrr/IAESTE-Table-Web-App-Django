We believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and engaging in dialogue with the research community, with our students, and with our industry partners. 

The Computer Vision, Perception &; Cognition Group (CVPC) conducts pattern recognition research, working on a wide variety of tasks relating to image, audio, and signal data per se. We focus on deep neural network and reinforcement learning methodology, inspired by biological learning. Each task we study has its own learning target (e.g., detection, classification, clustering, segmentation, novelty detection, control) and corresponding use case (e.g., predictive maintenance, speaker recognition for multimedia indexing, document analysis, optical music recognition, computer vision for industrial quality control, automated machine learning, deep reinforcement learning for automated game play or building control), which in turn sheds light on different aspects of the learning process. We use this experience to create increasingly general AI systems built on neural architectures. The university offers a competitive, technically stimulating, and exciting environment where you will have the opportunity to work with researchers and industrial partners. As an applied university, the research group is combining excellent research with industrial projects, to transfer research solutions to enterprise contexts.

The areas to investigate are predefined but it is appreciated if the intern will also come with own ideas of improvement.
