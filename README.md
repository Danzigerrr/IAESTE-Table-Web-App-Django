# IAESTETableFrontend

Check this project running live with Heroku [here](https://iaeste-offers-django-web-appkn.herokuapp.com/iaesteTable/offers/).

When I heard about IAESTE, I wanted to check their website and see the offers they had. I found only two options.

The first one is to check PDFs - single PDF contains information about one offer and before opening the PDF the user knows only the Ref. number of the offer.

The second one is to use the spreadsheet mentioned above. It is unsealable and the only way to look for offers that might interest you is to use "ctrl+f" method.

Therefore, I created this project, because I wanted to make the searching process much more comfortable, faster and easier for the user.

This web application is built using the Django framework.
